  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 24, 
      Encouragement Design/Instrumental Variables Estimation II.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: In the second session on encouragement design and instrument variables, we will 
      take a look at another dataset. Please make sure you have the Impact of Job Training 
      Provided under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) dataset loaded in your 
      environment before starting this. You can consult the instruction for importing at 
      the bottom of the pre-class work. 

- Class: video
  Output: Do you want to go to the link where the data is hosted?
  VideoLink: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ECwzWL2AHgY3JLaGVfZnZQVmc/view

  Output: Download the data and move it to your working directory. Then import it
      into R. Let us know if you have difficulty downloading the data.
      Make sure you name the dataset as "data". Also note that the data is in
      .dta format. Google which package you need to load the data. If you
      get an error and exit swirl, load the data first and then restart the swirl
      lesson.

  Output: We are stratifying our analysis by sex. Let's focus on the female for now
      (You can easily replicate the same procedure for male). 
      The variable indicating assignment is called assignmt and the variable
      indicating treatment is called training.
      Here, we subsetted our dataset into female (sex == 0), female_treat 
      (sex == 0 and training == 1), female_control (sex == 0 and training == 0) 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Here, we subsetted our dataset into female (sex == 0). 
      Run this, female = data[which(data$sex == 0),]
  CorrectAnswer: female = data[which(data$sex == 0),]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('female = data[which(data$sex == 0),]') 
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Here, then, we subset it into treatment group 
      Run this, female_treat = female[which(female$training == 1),]
  CorrectAnswer: female_treat = female[which(female$training == 1),]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('female_treat = female[which(female$training == 1),]') 
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then, control group. 
      Run this, female_control = female[which(female$training == 0),]
  CorrectAnswer: female_control = female[which(female$training == 0),]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('female_control = female[which(female$training == 0),]') 
  Hint: 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: the two groups (treated and control) are not necessarily balanced. 
      Why do you think the two groups are not balanced across treatment and control?
      Isn't the encouragment randomized?
  AnswerChoices: It happens; Encouragment is randomized but receiving treatment isn't; Encouragement is not randomized
  CorrectAnswer: Encouragment is randomized but receiving treatment isn't
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "Encouragment is randomized but receiving treatment isn't")

- Class: text
  Output: In addition to means, we could also look at the standard deviation, 
      plot the distribution, or evaluate it with MatchBalance or other plots. 
      But for now, let's assume that it's been done, and the groups are balanced. 

- Class: text
  Output: Next, we will evaluate whether the compliance was perfect. 
      We do so by calculating the compliance rate, as defined in the Diamond/
      Hainmueller paper in the last session. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the compliance rate among the female in the dataset?
      (Round your answer to 2 decimal points)
  AnswerChoices: 0.64;0.43;0.76;0.24
  CorrectAnswer: 0.64
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='0.64')
  Hint: compliance = Fraction of Subjects that were treated in the 
      encouraged group out of all encouraged individuals - Fraction 
      of Subjects that were treated in the non-encouraged group out of all
      non-encouraged individuals.

- Class: text
  Output: Good job. Compliance rate accounts for both the encouragement group and the non-encouragement group. 
      It will be used to calculate the Wald estimator later. Did you get an answer equal to 0.64.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the effect of the encouragement on workers' earning during 30 months
      after random assignment? Note that the outcome var is "earnings". (Round it with 2 decimals)
  CorrectAnswer: 1242.56
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "1242.56")
  Hint: Take the difference between the earnings of encouragement and non-encouragement group.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the impact of the JTPA program on female workers' earning, 
      based on the Wald estimator (LATE)? (Round it with no decimals)
  CorrectAnswer: 1941.5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "1941.5")
  Hint: Look up how the Wald estimator is calculated (LATE).

- Class: text
  Output: The LATE can be estimated from the formula, LATE = ITT / compliance rate.
      In this case, it's 1242.56/0.64 = 1941.5

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
