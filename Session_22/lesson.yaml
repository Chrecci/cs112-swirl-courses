  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 22, Synthetic Control II.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: In this lesson, you will implement synthetic control on the Basque region data set. 
      For the context of the dataset, see https://economics.mit.edu/files/11870. 
      Mostly, we will be learning about the parameters in the dataprep function, which is
      absolutely essential in implementing the synthetic control method. 

- Class: text
  Output: Make sure you have the Synth package installed and loaded. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The Basque country dataset is included in the Synth package. 
      This dataset is called 'basque'. Load the data into your environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(basque)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data("basque")', 'data(basque)') 
  Hint: You need to use the data() function. No need to save it to an object.
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: Take a look at the dataframe, what's the earliest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1955
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1955)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the latest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1997
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1997)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: text
  Output: For more context, the "exposure" or "treatment" (in this context, terrorist activity)
      is defined to begin at 1969. Thus, we are trying to make a synthetic control for the 
      period up to 1969. 

- Class: text
  Output: As we saw from the previous swirl lesson, the general procedures in 
      synthetic control are 1) data preparation, 2) synthetic control construction,
      and 3) producing results and graphs.
