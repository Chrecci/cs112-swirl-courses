  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 22, Synthetic Control II.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you will implement synthetic control on the Basque region data set. 
      For the context of the dataset, see https://economics.mit.edu/files/11870. 
      Mostly, we will be learning about the parameters in the dataprep function, which is
      absolutely essential in implementing the synthetic control method. 

- Class: text
  Output: Make sure you have the Synth package installed and loaded. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The Basque country dataset is included in the Synth package. 
      This dataset is called 'basque'. Load the data into your environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(basque)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data("basque")', 'data(basque)') 
  Hint: You need to use the data() function. No need to save it to an object.
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: Take a look at the dataframe, what's the earliest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1955
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1955)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the latest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1997
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1997)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: text
  Output: For more context, the "exposure" or "treatment" (in this context, terrorist activity)
      is defined to begin at 1969. Thus, we are trying to make a synthetic control for the 
      period up to 1969. 

- Class: text
  Output: As we saw from the previous swirl lesson, the general procedures in 
      synthetic control are 1) data preparation, 2) synthetic control construction,
      and 3) producing results and graphs. 

- Class: text
  Output: Due to its complexity, we will try to understand some important parameters 
      the dataprep process. Refer to the help files as needed (?dataprep).

- Class: exact_question
  Output: There is a parameter called foo. What should you input there?
  CorrectAnswer: basque
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "basque")
  Hint: foo specifies the dataframe with the data. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: There is a parameter called predictors. What does it refer to?
  AnswerChoices: The independent variables; The dependent variable
  CorrectAnswer: The independent variables
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "The independent variables")
  Hint: 
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: There is a parameter called unit.variable. It indicates the column that specifies
      the number that associates with the different units (different regions). 
      In the basque dataset, what is the column name that indicates this?
  CorrectAnswer: regionno
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "regionno")
  Hint: regionname specifies the actual name of the different regions, 
      is there a column with numbers that correspond to these names?
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: There is a parameter called time.variable. It indicates the column that 
      specifies the time variable. In the basque dataset, which variable is this?
  CorrectAnswer: year
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "year")
  Hint: Take a look at the dataset. 
      
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
  AnswerTests: cs112_credit(941, "22")
  Hint:
