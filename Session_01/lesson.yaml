  Output: Welcome to the first Swirl lesson for CS112. Swirl teaches you 
      R programming interactively from your console in RStudio. To do 
      this part of the assignment, follow these steps and let us know 
      if you run into any issues. At the end of the exercise, when you 
      complete all steps, you will get a unique code that you have to 
      paste in the Google Forms link provided at the end of the exercise 
      including your name. Please note that you can use the function 
      rpt() to go back to the previous question. To end your Swirl session,
      you can type bye(). After you exit a lesson, you can always resume
      a lesson by typing swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same 
      name you always use! Press any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: This is your first swirl lesson. You might run into issues in the
      beginning but once you resolve them, you should be good for the rest of
      the semester. You should let us or the TAs know if you run into issues
      that you cannot resolve. Press any key to continue!

  Output: In this exercise, we'll work with some very basic commands in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's create a vector of numbers called "letters" that contains the
      english letters "A", "B", and "C". Use the <- for assigning the values to 
      the object. Also because this is a vector of characters, you should put 
      each value inside quotation marks. 
  CorrectAnswer: letters <- c("A", "B", "C")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('letters <- c("A", "B", "C")')
  Hint: Did you use <- for assignment? Also did you save the vector to an object
      called letters? Also did you use c() for creating the vector?
      
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that you have created the vector, let's take a look at the object
      letters. You can call that object and see what's in it by just typing its
      name. Do so in this step.
  CorrectAnswer: letters
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('letters')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You can call a specific element in an object by using brackets. For
      instance, if we want to know the second elements in the object letters, 
      we simply type letters[2]. Use this command to check the second element of
      the object letters.
  CorrectAnswer: letters[2]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('letters[2]')
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, let's create a vector of numbers. Let's create a vector called
      numbers that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.
  CorrectAnswer: numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)')
  Hint: Did you use <- for assignment? Also did you save the vector to an object
      called letters? Also did you use c() for creating the vector?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Because this is a numerical vector, we can use functions that we can
      apply to numbers such as min, max, median, and mean. Use the mean function
      to find the mean of the vector numbers. 
  CorrectAnswer: mean(numbers)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mean(numbers)')

  Output: This is it. You have finished your first lesson in swirl. There will
      be a swirl exercise for each section. You are required to complete the swirl
      exercise before that session as your pre-class work. In the next step, there
      will be a unique code generated for you. You should copy and paste the code
      in the google form link that is provided to you and submit your pre-class work.
      You are responsible to correctly spell your name. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
