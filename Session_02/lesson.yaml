  Output: Welcome to your second Swirl lesson for CS112. Swirl teaches you 
      R programming interactively from your console in RStudio. To do 
      this part of the assignment, follow these steps and let us know 
      if you run into any issues. At the end of the exercise, when you 
      complete all steps, you will get a unique code that you have to 
      paste in the Google Forms link provided at the end of the exercise 
      including your name. Please note that you can use the function 
      rpt() to go back to the previous question. To end your Swirl session,
      you can type bye(). After you exit a lesson, you can always resume
      a lesson by typing swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same 
      name you always use! Press any key to continue!

  Output: This is your second swirl lesson. You might still be struggling with
      R and Swirl. Best way to deal with such issues is to first double check your
      answer. If you think it's right, then see if a simple Googling of the error
      you get finds the solution for you. If you're still stuck, post your problem
      in the class forum. One of the TAs or Profs. will get back to your question
      quickly. Press any key to continue!

  Output: In this exercise, we'll continue working with some very basic commands in R.
      Press any key to continue!

  Output: A data frame contains 1 or more rows and 1 or more columns. It's therefore
      technically a n by m matrix. Each column is usually a variable (vector) with 
      a name and each row is an observation in your data. Let's say you have data 
      on age and major of students at a university on 1000 students. Then you can
      present and store your data in a 1000 by 2 data. Each column would be one of the
      age or major variables. Each row would be a student. Press any key to continue!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: When you started this swirl lesson, a data frame has been automatically
      loaded in your environments. It's named students and you can find it in 
      your environment in the top right corner of your R. Type View(students) to
      take a look at the data. You can then click on x to close the window and 
      come back to the swirl exercise.
  CorrectAnswer: View(students)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('View(students)')
  Hint: 
      
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check how many rows are in this data set, we can use the nrow() function.
      Use the function to find the number of rows in the data set students. 
  CorrectAnswer: nrow(students)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('nrow(students)')
  Hint: Use the function nrow()
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check how many columns are in this data set, we can use the ncol() function.
      Use the function to find the number of columns in the data set students. 
  CorrectAnswer: ncol(students)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ncol(students)')
  Hint: Use the function ncol()
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To see the column names (variable names) in the data, you can use the
      function colnames(). Use this function to see what variables exist in the
      data set students. 
  CorrectAnswer: colnames(students)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('colnames(students)')
  Hint: Use the function colnames()
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To call a specific column in the data frame, we can use the $ sign.
      For instance, we can use students$major to see the vector of all majors.
      Type students$major to see what is shown.
  CorrectAnswer: students$major
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('students$major')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that you now how to use the $ sign, use the mean() function to find
      the mean of the vector age in the data set. 
  CorrectAnswer: mean(students$age)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mean(students$age)')
  Hint: Use the mean() function. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the max() function to find the highest age in the data set. 
  CorrectAnswer: max(students$age)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('max(students$age)')
  Hint: Use the max() function.

  Output: Congratulations! You have finished your second lesson in swirl. There will
      be a swirl exercise for each section. You are required to complete the swirl
      exercise before that session as your pre-class work. In the next step, there
      will be a unique code generated for you. You should copy and paste the code
      in the google form link that is provided to you and submit your pre-class work.
      You are responsible to correctly spell your name. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
