  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 11, The bride to causal inferece. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: Remember the Lalonde experiment and the lalonde data which we have used
      before. The original paper is about a randomized experiment. But in this
      exercise, we are going to work with the observational version of the of the 
      lalonde data set. Hit any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: Let's download the data from the following link 
      "http://bit.ly/lalonde_observational" This is a direct link and the data 
      is in csv format. Use the approapriate function in R to load the csv file
      into your environment. Assign the data to an object call lalonde_obs.
      If you are having difficulties with firewalls in your country, make sure
      you download the file first and locally load it into your environment.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's look at the head of the data. Again, make sure you have loaded
      the dataset into your environment first.
  CorrectAnswer: head(lalonde_obs)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('head(lalonde_obs)')
  Hint: Did you load the data first and did you assign it to an object calle lalonde_obs?

- Class: text
  Output: Unlike the STANDARD version of "lalonde", which we've been using until
      now, which was derived from a randomized experiment, this dataset is 
      special. Let's see how!

- Class: text
  Output: this version takes the TREATMENT group from the randomized experiment 
      data, and merges this treatment group with a control group of US census data.
      In other words, all the treat == 1 observations in this dataset come from 
      data(lalonde) that we have seen before, and the treat == 0 observations 
      come from survey data.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, try running a linear regression model using the lm() function.
      In your model, the variable re78 is the outcome variable and the treatment
      variable is the "treat" variable. Don't use any other independent variable.
      Assign your model to an object called lm01
  CorrectAnswer: lm01 <- lm(re78 ~ treat, data  = lalonde_obs)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lm01 <- lm(re78 ~ treat, data  = lalonde_obs)', 'lm01 <- lm(lalonde_obs$re78 ~ lalonde_obs$treat)')
  Hint: Did you assign the output of your model to an object called lm01?
      
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Should you interpret this coefficient as a causal effect?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: Note that because the control group is no longer experimental and it 
      comes from the US census data, hence it is observational, we can't directly
      draw causal conclusions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, try running a different linear regression model. In this model,
      regress re78 on treat and age and educ. Assign your model to an object 
      called lm02
  CorrectAnswer: lm02 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + age + educ, data  = lalonde_obs)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lm02 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + age + educ, data  = lalonde_obs)', 'lm02 <- lm(lalonde_obs$re78 ~ lalonde_obs$treat + lalonde_obs$age + lalonde_obs$educ)')
  Hint: Did you assign the output of your model to an object called lm02?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, try running a different linear regression model. In this model,
      regress re78 on every other variable (including treat) excluding the variable
      re75. Use the "~ ." notation and then exclude re75 by immediately typing
      "-re75" after ".". Therefore, you should type "re78 ~.-re75".
      Assign your model to an object called lm03
  CorrectAnswer: lm03 <- lm(re78 ~.-re75, data  = lalonde_obs)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('lm03 <- lm(re78 ~.-re75, data  = lalonde_obs)', 'lm03 <- lm(lalonde_obs$re78 ~.-lalonde_obs$re75)')
  Hint: Did you assign the output of your model to an object called lm03?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Look at the summary of your first model lm01.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm01)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('summary(lm01)')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then the summary of your second model lm01.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm02)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('summary(lm02)')
  Hint: 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, look at the summary of your third model lm03.
  CorrectAnswer: summary(lm03)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('summary(lm03)')
  Hint: 

- Class: mult_question
  Output:  Do different linear regression models deliver stable results for 
      the treat coefficient?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: 
      
      
- Class: text
  Output: If you answered No to the previous question, you are right. When we change
      the set of variables to include in our regression, the treatment effect
      changes significantly. This is mainly because we are working with observational
      data. Hit any key to continue!

- Class: text
  Output: Good job! Even though the coding for this exercise was very similar to
      what we've done in the past, this swirl exercise is our first introduction
      to observational data. We will soon learn methods in causal inference that
      help us understand causal questions even in non-experimental settings.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
