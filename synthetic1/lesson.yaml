  Output: Welcome to the CS112 Swirl lesson on Basics of Synthetic Control. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We first need to install the package 'Synth'.
      You can use the command install.packages("Synth") or 
      install.packages('Synth', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/').
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages('Synth', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')
  AnswerTest: any_of_exprs('install.packages('Synth', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')', 'install.packages("Synth")')
  Hint:

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, load the package.
  CorrectAnswer: library(Synth)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(Synth)')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We are going to use the simple toy data that come with the package.
      This dataset is called 'synth.data'. Load the data into your environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(synth.data)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(synth.data)')
  Hint: You need to use the data() function.
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the earliest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1980
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1980)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the latest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 2000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 2000)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: We can also plot the quantile regression line using the 'plot' and
      'abline' functions in R.\n
      plot(foodexp ~ income, data = engel, pch = 16, main = "foodexp ~ income");
      abline(lm(foodexp ~ income, data = engel), col = "red", lty = 2);
      abline(rq(foodexp ~ income, data = engel), col = "blue", lty = 2);
      legend("topright", legend = c("lm", "rq"), col = c("red", "blue"), lty = 2);
      The quantile regression line is in blue and the linear regression line is
      in red.
