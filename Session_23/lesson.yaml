  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 23, Encouragement Design/Instrumental Variables Estimation.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

- Class: text
  Output: The mathematical basis of the content in this session is rather simple,
      so we will be focusing on the concepts of encouragement design and instrumental
      variables. We will discussing select questions from the pre-class work document.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: a) Why is the all-cause death rate similar in the encouragement group (27)
      and the non-encouragement group (28)?
  AnswerChoices: Just happened to be; Breast cancer screening is randomized; Encouragement is randomized
  CorrectAnswer: Encouragement is randomized
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Encouragement is randomized')

- Class: text
  Output: The "intervention" being randomized here is the assignment of encouragement.
      This is because it's unethical to deny people screening and truly randomize it.
      Thus, the encouragement and non-encouragement groups are balanced. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: b/c) Why are the all-cause death rate different between refused vs. examined?
  AnswerChoices: Mediators; Lack of randomization; Confounders
  CorrectAnswer: Confounders
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'Confounders')

- Class: text
  Output: Confounders may be at play here. The fact that some people accept and other 
      refused treatment may say something about other characteristics like openness
      to healthcare or other factors that influence health outcomes. We can't really
      "randomize" anything here, because refusing and accepting the encouragement are
      personal choices. Mediators are not relevant in this context. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: d) Is comparing the outcome between refused (1.5) vs. examined (1.1) groups unbiased?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'No')

- Class: text
  Output: It is not! As we discussed in b and c, the two groups are not balanced, because
      there is likely confounders that bias the results. Looking at the all-cause mortality
      rate, it seems that the refused group is generally more unhealthy than the accepted 
      group. Therefore, the estimate (1.5 - 1.1 = 0.4) will likely be an overestimation. 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: f) What is the intention to treat effect (ITT) of breast-cancer mortality?
  CorrectAnswer: -0.7
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = -0.7)
  Hint: Look up how ITT is calculated.

- Class: text
  Output: The ITT for breast-cancer mortality is the difference of breast-cancer mortality
      between the encouragement and the non-encouragement group. 1.3 - 2.0 = -0.7

- Class: exact_question
  Output: pre-g) What is the compliance rate? (Round your answer to 3 decimals)
  CorrectAnswer: 0.652
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 0.652)
  Hint: 

- Class: text
  Output: Note that the full formula for compliance rate accounts for the people who received
      screening in both the encouragement and non-encouragement groups. We simply assume that
      no one in the non-encouragement group received the screening. 
      (We should consider whether this is a reasonable assumption)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: g) What is the local average treatment effect (LATE) of breast-cancer mortality?
      (Round your answer to 2 decimal points)
  CorrectAnswer: -1.07
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = -1.07)
  Hint: Look up how LATE is calculated.

- Class: text
  Output: The LATE can be estimated from the formula, LATE = ITT / compliance rate.
      In this case, it's -0.7 / 0.652 = -1.07 

- Class: text
  Output: The ITT and LATE for all-cause mortality can be easily calculated using the same
      procedure outlined in f and g. 

- Class: text
  Output: Next, consider the assumptions required for the LATE calculation.
      Do you think the method is clever? Bring your thoughts to discuss in class. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
