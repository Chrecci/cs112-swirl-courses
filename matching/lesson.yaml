  Output: Welcome to the CS112 Swirl lesson on Matching. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, load the package Matching.
  CorrectAnswer: library(Matching)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='library(Matching)')
  Hint: You need to use the library() function.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then load the data lalonde from the package Matching.
  CorrectAnswer: data(lalonde)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='data(lalonde)')
  Hint: You need to use the data() function.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, estimate the propensity score using the covariates 'age, age^2, educ, educ^2, black, hisp, married' in the order they appear and assign it to an object called glm1.
  CorrectAnswer: glm1 <- glm(treat ~ age + I(age^2) + educ + I(educ^2) + black + hisp + married, family=binomial, data=lalonde)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='glm1 <- glm(treat ~ age + I(age^2) + educ + I(educ^2) + black + hisp + married, family=binomial, data=lalonde)')
  Hint: Note the treatment variable is your dependent variable. Also, you need to use a logistic regression.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now that you have estimated the propensity score, assign the predicted value of the propensity score to an object called X.
  CorrectAnswer: X <- glm1$fitted.values
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='X <- glm1$fitted.values')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  NumTimes: 1
  Token: |
      num1 = sample(1:nrow(lalonde),1)
  Output: How do you find the <num1>th element of the vector X.
  CorrectAnswer: X[<num1>]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='X[<num1>]')
  HintFunction: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In this step, we are going to do a one-to-one matching with replacement (the "M=1" option). 
    Use the appropriate function from the Matching library and assign the result to an object called rr.
  CorrectAnswer: rr <- Match(Y=lalonde$re78, Tr= lalonde$treat, X=X, M=1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rr <- Match(Y=lalonde$re78, Tr= lalonde$treat, X=X, M=1)')
