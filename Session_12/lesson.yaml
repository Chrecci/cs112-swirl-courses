  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 12, Counterfactuals, The Rubin Causal Model. 
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

  Output: Please do this session after you completed the readings (at least the Wikipedia page), 
      as this will be a light practice on the concepts.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's say we want to investigate the effect of gender on salary. 
      The variables we have handy are salary (outcome), female (treatment; 1 for female, 0 for male), and education (covariate).
      Assume that we know that the variables are related by the equation, salary = -2*female + 5*education. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: We have a hypothetical person, Mini, who is female and college-educated (16 years of education).
      What is the potential outcome (salary), given the equation above. 
  AnswerChoices: 82;78;80;3
  CorrectAnswer: 78
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='78')
  Hint: Plug the values into the equation.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's assume in an alternate universe, Mini is identical except that the gender is male.
      What is the potential outcome (salary) now, given the equation above. 
      (This is the counterfactual.)
  AnswerChoices: 82;78;80;3
  CorrectAnswer: 80
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='80')
  Hint: Plug the values into the equation.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the treatment effect of 'being female' for Mini? 
  AnswerChoices: 1;-1;2;-2;5;-5
  CorrectAnswer: -2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='-2')
  Hint: Calculate the difference between the potential outcomes. 

- Class: text
  Output: Note that the treatment effect we calculated from taking the difference between the potential outcome is 
      identical to that of the equation. In reality, however, we don't have access to a formula that tells us the 
      relationship between variables. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Also, do we get to observe both potential outcomes?
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='No')
  Hint: We either get to observe the scenario where Mini is a female OR the scenario where Mini is male. 
      Therefore, we don't get to calculate the treatment effect for Mini in this case. 
      This is called "the fundamental problem of causal inference". 

- Class: text
  Output: Now we have data on two other people, Mike and Mark. 
      Mike is male and has been educated for 10 years.
      Mark is male and has been educated for 17 years. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If you had to choose either Mike or Mark to compare to Mini in order to estimate the treatment effect,
      who would you choose?
  AnswerChoices: Mike;Mark
  CorrectAnswer: Mark
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Mark')
  Hint: Who is more "similar" to Mini?

- Class: text
  Output: Given the limited information we have, Mark is the better choice because he is "more similar" to Mini on the 
      covariates (independent variables that aren't the treatment variable). Therefore, it would provide a better 
      estimate of the treatment effect. 
      If we use Mike, then the estimated treatment effect is 78-50 = 28.
      If we use Mark, then the estimated treatment effect is 78-85 = -7. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: Good job on this lesson. Try to wrap your head around the concepts of counterfactuals and potential outcomes. 
      The last part alludes to a method that will be used to circumvent the fundamental problem of causal inference, matching.

  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
