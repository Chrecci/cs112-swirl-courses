  Output: Welcome to the Swirl lesson for CS112 Session 21, Synthetic Control I.
      Please note that you can use the function rpt() to go back to the
      previous question. To end your Swirl session, you can type bye().
      After you exit a lesson, you can always resume a lesson by typing 
      swirl() again. However, make sure you use the same name you always use!

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you will implement a simple synthetic control. It will 
      give you an overview on how it works. Please refer to the documentation as
      needed. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If you haven't already installed the package, first install it using
      install.packages("Synth", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/"). Then, 
      load the package.
  CorrectAnswer: library(Synth)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(Synth)', 'library("Synth")')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We are going to use the simple toy data that come with the package.
      This dataset is called 'synth.data'. Load the data into your environment.
  CorrectAnswer: data(synth.data)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data("synth.data")', 'data(synth.data)') 
  Hint: You need to use the data() function. No need to save it to an object.
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the earliest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 1980
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 1980)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What's the latest year the data covers?
  CorrectAnswer: 2000
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 2000)
  Hint: Look at the variable year.
  
- Class: figure
  Output: In the synth.data dataset, the predictors are X1, X2, and X3, and 
      Y is the outcome variable. Variables unit.num and name are unit identifiers.
      Unit 7 is the treatment unit and units 29, 2, 13, 17, 32, and 38 are control units.
      For your convenience, we have already converted the panel dataset 
      to a object suitable for running the synth() function by using the dataprep()
      function. The output is called dataprep.out. Hit enter to continue.
  Figure: data_prep.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the subject dataprep.out and the synth() function to identify the weights
      that create the best possible synthetic control unit for the treated and
      assign the result to an object called synth.out.
  CorrectAnswer: synth.out <- synth(dataprep.out)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='synth.out <- synth(dataprep.out)')
  Hint: Did you use <- instead of = ?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run synth.out$solution.w to check the weights you obtained.
  CorrectAnswer: synth.out$solution.w
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='synth.out$solution.w')
  Hint: 
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your results in the previous step, 
      which control unit has the highest weight?
  AnswerChoices: 17;29;32;38
  CorrectAnswer: 32
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='32')
  Hint:
  
- Class: figure
  Output: We can summarise the result of the synth() function. To get summary
      tables for all information, we can use the synth.tab() function in order
      to compare the treatment and the synthetic control units across the 
      predictors. The table is shown in your console. Hit enter to continue!
  Figure: synth_table.R
  FigureType: new
  
- Class: figure
  Output: We can also look at the summary plots for outcome trajectories 
      of the treated and the synthetic control unit using the path.plot()
      function. The figure is shown here. Hit enter to continue!
  Figure: path_plot.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: Good job. This is a friendly introduction to how to implement 
      synthetic controls. We will be looking at it in more detail in 
      the next lesson. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "Would you like the code-generator to generate a code for you?"
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: NULL
